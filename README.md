## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbols (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
